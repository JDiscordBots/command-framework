# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities should **not** be reported as an issue on github because anyone can see this issue and use it.

On the other hand, Security vulnerabilities should be reported **as fast as possible**.

Instead, they should be as a private message on Discord to user [`dan1st#7327`](https://discord.com/users/358291050957111296) or [`Gehasstes#0001`](https://discord.com/users/321227144791326730).

Private Messages are only allowed if the both users are member of a common server (Guild).
In order to bypass that, you can join [this Server](https://discord.gg/sSTCSfP)
